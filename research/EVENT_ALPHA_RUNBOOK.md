# Event Alpha Radar Runbook

Event Alpha is a research-only catalyst radar. It can discover evidence,
refresh watchlist rows, route research digests, write review artifacts, and
export proposed eval cases. It must not trade, paper trade, write normal RSI
signal rows, or let LLM/search/watchlist output create `TRIGGERED_FADE`.

## Daily No-Key Operation

Use the no-key profile when you want public RSS/GDELT/Polymarket plus live
CoinGecko-style market rows without OpenAI calls:

```bash
make event-alpha-daily-report PROFILE=no_key_live
```

This prints profile status, runs the cycle, writes alert snapshots and run-ledger
rows, prints router output, and summarizes alert snapshots. If no alerts arrive,
run:

```bash
make event-alpha-explain-last-run
make event-alpha-open-items
```

The first command explains where the funnel stopped. The second checks active
watchlist monitoring, missed opportunities, and calibration.

## Full LLM No-Send Review

Use the full LLM profile only when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured and you want
OpenAI extraction/advisory metadata without sending:

```bash
make event-alpha-daily-llm-report PROFILE=full_llm_live
```

LLM calls are capped by the profile budget defaults and the local budget ledger.
Cache hits are reused. If rows are skipped, the run ledger and explain report
show `llm_skipped_due_budget`.

## Guarded Research Send

Research sends are opt-in. They send only router-approved Event Alpha decisions,
not the broad rule-alert digest:

```bash
RSI_EVENT_ALERTS_ENABLED=1 make event-alpha-daily-send PROFILE=research_send
```

The send path still requires `research_only` alert mode and the normal Telegram
credentials. If no router-approved escalation exists, the cycle records a send
block reason instead of sending a broad digest.

## Feedback Labels

Use lightweight labels after reviewing cards or digests:

```bash
python3 main.py --event-feedback-mark ALERT_KEY --event-feedback-label useful
python3 main.py --event-feedback-mark ALERT_KEY --event-feedback-label junk --event-feedback-notes "publisher noise"
python3 main.py --event-feedback-report
```

Allowed labels are `useful`, `junk`, `watch`, `missed`, `traded_elsewhere`, and
`ignored`. Feedback is a research artifact only; it does not mutate watchlist
state or alert tiers.

## Calibration Workflow

After feedback and outcomes accrue:

```bash
make event-alpha-calibration-report
make event-source-reliability-report
make event-alpha-calibration-export-priors
```

The priors export is reviewable JSON. It is not applied automatically. Treat it
as a proposal for manual threshold or source-prior changes.

## Research Cards

Print one card:

```bash
make event-research-cards ALERT_KEY=cluster_id\|coin_id\|playbook
```

Write selected cards and an index:

```bash
make event-research-cards-write
```

Cards are Markdown artifacts under `RSI_EVENT_RESEARCH_CARDS_DIR` and include
playbook, source evidence, LLM interpretation, market confirmation, warnings,
verification steps, invalidation, and outcome fields.

## When No Alerts Arrive

Run:

```bash
make event-alpha-explain-last-run
make event-alpha-status PROFILE=no_key_live
make event-alpha-runs-report
```

Common causes:

- no source events or market anomalies entered the cycle
- resolver/classifier gates rejected noisy source rows
- all rows stayed `STORE_ONLY`
- watchlist/router had no escalation after cooldown and duplicate suppression
- send was requested but blocked by missing opt-in or no alertable route
- LLM budget was exhausted and lower-priority rows were skipped

## When Alerts Are Noisy

Run:

```bash
make event-source-reliability-report
make event-alpha-calibration-report
make event-alpha-export-eval-cases
```

Then inspect proposed eval cases under
`event_fade_cache/proposed_eval_cases/`. Promote useful proposed cases manually
into the canonical fixture files only after reviewing the evidence and expected
labels.

## Proposed Eval Case Promotion

The exporter writes proposals only. To promote a case:

1. Open the proposed JSON file.
2. Verify the source text, expected label, and asset identity.
3. Copy the case into the appropriate canonical fixture:
   `fixtures/event_discovery/llm_golden_cases.json`,
   `fixtures/event_discovery/llm_extraction_golden_cases.json`, or
   `fixtures/event_discovery/event_alpha_golden_cases.json`.
4. Run:

```bash
make event-llm-eval PYTHON=python3
make event-llm-extract-eval PYTHON=python3
make event-alpha-eval PYTHON=python3
```

## Promotion Boundary

Do not promote Event Alpha beyond local reports/research digests until reviewed
samples show durable usefulness after false positives, missed opportunities,
outcomes, and source reliability are measured. `TRIGGERED_FADE` remains
reserved for deterministic `event_fade.py` output on `proxy_fade` rows.
